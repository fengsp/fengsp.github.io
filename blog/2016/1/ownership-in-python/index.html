    <p>In C or C++, we are responsible for the allocation and deallocation of memory.
Every piece of memory allocated should eventually be freed, otherwise we have
a memory leak.  It is really hard to prevent leaks from happening by manual
management.</p>
<p>In Python, we use reference counting as the strategy to avoid memory leaks.
The idea is simple: everything is one object and every object has a counter,
which keeps the total number of references to this object.  When the counter
drops to 0, the object should be freed, the operation is also safe because
we know it is used in nowhere.</p>
<p>What interests me most is how does this happen under the hood.  After some
exploration, I think I have something here and want to share it with you.</p>
<p>In CPython, two macros called <code>Py_INCREF(x)</code> and <code>Py_DECREF(x)</code> are used to
handle the increment and decrement of the reference count.  There are a few
questions though, when should we use them and how are they used in CPython
implementation?</p>
<p>We should use <code>Py_INCREF(x)</code> when we need ownership of an object.  What is
ownership, if you want to use one object, you have to own it, otherwise it
might be taken away from you by others, in our case, you have to inform the
garbage collector that you are using the object, or gc might free it.  However
it is totally free for you to <strong>borrow</strong> one object, if you are 100% sure
the owners hold on to the object longer than you.  <strong>The ownership in Python
means you keep a reference to one object.</strong>  All owners of one object should
call <code>Py_DECREF(x)</code> after they finish using the object, otherwise a memory
leak is created.  Here is one simple example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;hi&#39;</span>  <span class="c"># s keeps a reference to &#39;hi&#39; and have ownership</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">s</span>   <span class="c"># use &#39;hi&#39; for something</span>
<span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">()</span>       <span class="c"># s finishes and decreases the reference count</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It is also possible to transfer the ownership to others, never heard of it?
Trust me, it happens everywhere, everytime we create a new object, we need to
pass ownership to the receiver:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># we need the bytecode of it</span>

<span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">LOAD_NAME</span>                <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">3</span> <span class="n">LOAD_NAME</span>                <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">6</span> <span class="n">BUILD_TUPLE</span>              <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="mi">9</span> <span class="n">STORE_NAME</span>               <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In the above example, we can see that <code>foo</code> have ownership on a tuple object
in the end, however, the <code>Py_INCREF(x)</code> was called when <em>BUILD_TUPLE</em> was
executed, during the <em>BUILD_TUPLE</em> execution, <code>PyTuple_New</code> is called and it
create a new tuple object, the object leaves the <code>PyTuple_New</code> function call
and <code>Py_DECREF(x)</code> is not called, afterwards, the ownership is passed to
Python Virtual Machine data stack, the VM passes it to the <code>foo</code> variable.</p>
<p>What if I write code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># no final receiver for the ownership</span>

<span class="mi">6</span> <span class="n">BUILD_TUPLE</span>
<span class="mi">9</span> <span class="n">POP_TOP</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The compiler is smart enough to catch that, the ownership is passed to
Python Virtual Machine data stack, during <em>POP_TOP</em> execution, the <code>Py_DECREF</code>
is called.</p>
<p>So far, everything is simple, we want to use one object, we just keep a
reference to it, we finish using it, we <code>Py_DECREF</code> it or pass the ownership
to others.  What about functions?  How to make sure everything works right
for a returned value from function?  If you are calling a normal Python
function, the returned object will pass its ownership to the receiver.  The
Python itself makes sure that all returned object has the ownership.  Things
get a little uncertain if you call a C function from Python, in order to make
things work right, as a Python C Extension developer, you have to return
an object that has its ownership:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">PyObject</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="nf">get_first_item</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PyObject</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">PyObject</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">item</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">PyList_GetItem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="cm">/* do not have ownership */</span>
    <span class="n">Py_INCREF</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="cm">/* get ownership */</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="cm">/* safe to return */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
